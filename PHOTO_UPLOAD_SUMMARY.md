# Photo Upload Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a complete photo upload feature for Mayhouse experiences using Supabase Object Storage. Here's what was added:

### 🗄️ Database Layer

**File**: `backend/database/migrations/003_create_experience_photos_table.sql`

- Created `experience_photos` table with:
  - `id`, `experience_id`, `photo_url`, `is_cover_photo`, `display_order`, `caption`, `uploaded_at`
  - Database constraint ensuring only one cover photo per experience
  - Optimized indexes for fast queries
  - Cascade delete (photos deleted when experience is deleted)

### 📦 Backend Implementation

**1. Schemas** (`backend/app/schemas/experience_photo.py`):
- `ExperiencePhotoBase`, `ExperiencePhotoCreate`, `ExperiencePhotoUpdate`
- `ExperiencePhotoResponse`, `ExperiencePhotoUploadResponse`

**2. Service Layer** (`backend/app/services/photo_upload_service.py`):
- `PhotoUploadService` class with methods:
  - `upload_photo_to_storage()` - Uploads to Supabase Storage
  - `create_photo_record()` - Saves metadata to database
  - `get_experience_photos()` - Retrieves photos for an experience
  - `delete_photo()` - Removes photo from storage and database
  - `update_photo_metadata()` - Updates caption, cover status, etc.
- File validation (type, size)
- Unique filename generation
- Authorization checks

**3. API Endpoints** (`backend/app/api/experience_photos.py`):
- `POST /experiences/{id}/photos` - Upload photo
- `GET /experiences/{id}/photos` - Get all photos
- `PATCH /experiences/{id}/photos/{photo_id}` - Update metadata
- `DELETE /experiences/{id}/photos/{photo_id}` - Delete photo

**4. Main App** (`backend/main.py`):
- Registered the photo upload router

### 🎨 Frontend Implementation

**1. Photo Upload Component** (`frontend/src/components/ExperiencePhotoUpload.tsx`):
- Drag-and-drop photo upload interface
- Multi-file upload support
- Real-time upload progress bar
- Photo grid with hover actions
- Cover photo badge
- Caption editing
- Delete functionality
- Set as cover photo button
- Validates file types and sizes
- Maximum 10 photos per experience

**2. Design Experience Page** (`frontend/src/app/design-experience/page.tsx`):
- Added Step 4: "Photos & Final Review"
- Updated progress indicator (4 steps instead of 3)
- Modified flow:
  - Steps 1-3: Experience details
  - After Step 3, experience is saved as draft
  - Step 4: Photo upload
  - "Done" button takes to dashboard
- Integrated `ExperiencePhotoUpload` component

### 📚 Documentation

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Developers

1. **Run Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Execute the SQL migration in Supabase Dashboard
   # File: backend/database/migrations/003_create_experience_photos_table.sql
   ```

2. **Create Storage Bucket**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
   - Create bucket named: `experience-photos`
   - Make it public
   - Set file size limit: 5MB

3. **Environment Variables** (should already be set):
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_URL=...
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
   ```

4. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

### For Hosts (Users)

1. Navigate to "Design Experience" page
2. Fill in experience details (Steps 1-3)
3. Click "Continue to Photos"
4. Experience is saved automatically
5. Upload photos via:
   - Drag & drop files into the upload area
   - Or click to browse files
6. Manage photos:
   - Add captions by typing below each photo
   - Change cover photo by clicking "Set as Cover"
   - Delete unwanted photos
7. Click "Done - Go to Dashboard" when finished

## 📋 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `backend/database/migrations/003_create_experience_photos_table.sql`
- `backend/app/schemas/experience_photo.py`
- `backend/app/services/photo_upload_service.py`
- `backend/app/api/experience_photos.py`
- `frontend/src/components/ExperiencePhotoUpload.tsx`
- `PHOTO_UPLOAD_FEATURE.md`
- `PHOTO_UPLOAD_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified Files:
- `backend/main.py` (added photo router)

## ⚙️ Technical Details

**Storage Structure**:
```
experience-photos/
  └── experiences/
      └── {experience_id}/
          └── {timestamp}_{uuid}.{ext}
```

**File Restrictions**:
- Types: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WebP
- Max Size: 5MB per file
- Max Photos: 10 per experience

**Cover Photo Logic**:
- First uploaded photo is automatically the cover
- Only one cover photo allowed per experience
- Database constraint enforces this
- When setting new cover, old cover is automatically unset

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ JWT authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Authorization check (only host can manage their photos)
- ✅ Server-side file validation
- ✅ Unique filename generation prevents collisions
- ✅ Cascade delete ensures no orphaned photos

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
experience_photos (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    experience_id UUID REFERENCES experiences(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    photo_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_cover_photo BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    caption TEXT,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Constraint: Only one cover photo per experience
    CONSTRAINT unique_cover_photo_per_experience ...
);
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

- Clean, modern design matching Mayhouse style
- Red accent colors consistent with brand
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive grid layout (2-3 columns)
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Clear error messages
- Visual feedback for drag-and-drop
