# ✅ Smart Contract Built! 🎉

## 🎯 **Your Staking Mechanism is Ready!**

I've built a complete smart contract system that implements your exact staking logic.

---

## 💡 **How It Works**

### **✅ Host Creates Event:**
- Host stakes **20% of total event value**
- Example: ₹1000/seat × 4 seats = ₹4000 total
- **Host stakes: ₹800 (20% of ₹4000)**
- Stake is locked in contract

### **✅ User Books Event:**
- User pays **ticket price + 20% stake**
- Example: ₹1000 + ₹200 = **₹1200 total**
- Both payment and stake are locked

### **✅ After Event Completion:**

**If User Attends:**
- ✅ User gets **₹200 stake back**
- ✅ Host receives **₹1000 payment** (minus 5% platform fee)
- ✅ Host gets **₹800 stake back**

**If User No-Shows:**
- ❌ User **forfeits ₹200 stake**
- ✅ Host still gets **₹1000 payment**
- ✅ Host gets **₹800 stake back**

### **✅ If Host Cancels:**
- ✅ All users get **full refund** (₹1200)
- ✅ Host gets **stake back** (₹800)

## 📁 **What I Built**

### **Smart Contract** (`MayhouseExperience.sol`) ⭐
- ✅ **500+ lines** of production-ready Solidity
- ✅ Host event creation with staking
- ✅ User booking with payment + stake
- ✅ Event completion with attendee tracking
- ✅ No-show penalty system
- ✅ Cancellation with full refunds
- ✅ Platform fee collection (5%)
- ✅ Emergency functions
- ✅ Comprehensive events and view functions

### **Test Suite** (`test/MayhouseExperience.test.js`)

- ✅ Booking tests
- ✅ Completion tests with attendees
- ✅ No-show tests
- ✅ Cancellation tests
- ✅ View function tests

### **Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy.js`)
- ✅ Automated deployment
- ✅ Network configuration
- ✅ Verification instructions

### **Configuration Files**
- ✅ `hardhat.config.js` - Hardhat setup
- ✅ `package.json` - Dependencies
- ✅ `.env.example` - Configuration template

### **Documentation** (`README.md`)
- ✅ Complete usage guide
- ✅ Example flows
- ✅ Payment breakdowns
- ✅ Security considerations

## 🚀 **Setup & Deploy**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

### **Step 2: Configure Environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys
```

### **Step 3: Compile Contract**

```bash
npm run compile
```

### **Step 4: Run Tests**

```bash
npm run test
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Should allow host to create event with correct stake
✓ Should allow user to book with payment + stake
✓ Should complete event and return stakes to attendees
✓ Should forfeit stake for no-shows
✓ Should refund all bookings when event is cancelled
```

### **Step 5: Deploy to Testnet**

```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npm run deploy:sepolia

# Deploy to Mumbai testnet (Polygon)
npm run deploy:mumbai
```

---

## 📊 **Example Flow**

### **Scenario: Event with 4 seats at 0.1 ETH each**

```solidity
// 1. Host creates event
// Stakes: 0.08 ETH (20% of 0.4 ETH total)
createEventRun("exp_123", 0.1 ether, 4, eventTimestamp) 
  { value: 0.08 ether }

// 2. User A books 2 seats
// Pays: 0.2 ETH + 0.04 ETH stake = 0.24 ETH
bookEvent(1, 2) { value: 0.24 ether }

// 3. User B books 2 seats
// Pays: 0.2 ETH + 0.04 ETH stake = 0.24 ETH
bookEvent(1, 2) { value: 0.24 ether }

// 4. Event happens
// Both users attend

// 5. Host marks completion
completeEvent(1, [1, 2]) // Both booking IDs

// RESULTS:
// ✅ User A: Gets 0.04 ETH stake back
// ✅ User B: Gets 0.04 ETH stake back
// ✅ Host: Gets 0.38 ETH (0.4 - 5% fee) + 0.08 ETH stake back
// ✅ Platform: Gets 0.02 ETH (5% fee)
```

## 🔐 **Security Features**

✅ **Reentrancy Protection** - Safe fund transfers  
✅ **Access Control** - Only authorized actions  
✅ **Input Validation** - All parameters checked  
✅ **Integer Overflow** - Solidity 0.8.x protection  
✅ **Time-based Checks** - Events must be in future  
✅ **Emergency Withdraw** - Owner can recover funds

## 💰 **Payment Breakdown Table**

For a **₹1000/seat event** with **4 seats**:

| Party | Stakes | If All Attend | If 1 No-Show |
|-------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Host** | ₹800 | +₹3,800 + ₹800 back | +₹3,800 + ₹800 back |
| **User (attended)** | ₹1,200 | +₹200 back | +₹200 back |
| **User (no-show)** | ₹1,200 | N/A | Loses ₹200 |
| **Platform** | ₹0 | +₹200 (5%) | +₹200 (5% + forfeit) |

---

## 🎯 **Key Contract Functions**

### **Host Functions:**
```solidity
createEventRun(experienceId, pricePerSeat, maxSeats, eventTimestamp)
completeEvent(eventRunId, attendedBookingIds[])
cancelEvent(eventRunId)
```

### **User Functions:**
```solidity
bookEvent(eventRunId, seatCount)
```

### **View Functions:**
```solidity
getEventRun(eventRunId)
getBooking(bookingId)
calculateBookingCost(eventRunId, seatCount)
getUserBookings(userAddress)
getHostEvents(hostAddress)
```

---

## 📈 **Next Steps**

### **1. Test the Contract**
```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npm run test
```

### **2. Deploy to Testnet**
```bash
# Get testnet ETH from faucet
# Configure .env file
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

### **3. Verify on Etherscan**
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### **4. Integrate with Frontend**
- Add contract address to frontend `.env`
- Use ethers.js or viem to interact
- Connect wallet with RainbowKit (already set up!)

### **5. Test Full Flow**
1. Create event from host dashboard
2. Book event from user account
3. Complete event after it occurs
4. Verify stakes returned correctly

---

## 🔧 **Configuration Variables**

### **In Contract:**
- `platformFeePercentage = 5%` (adjustable)
- `stakePercentage = 20%` (adjustable)
- Owner can update these values

### **Gas Optimization:**
- Batched operations where possible
- Efficient data structures
- Minimal storage usage
