## 🎯 **Frontend Integration - Already Done! ✅**

I've added the contract address to your frontend:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x09aB660CEac220678b42E0e23DebCb1475e1eAD5
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
```

## 🔍 **Verify Contract (Optional but Recommended)**

To make your contract code readable on Etherscan:

### **Step 1: Get Etherscan API Key**
1. Go to: https://etherscan.io/register
2. Create account
3. Go to: https://etherscan.io/myapikey
4. Create API key
5. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

### **Step 2: Run Verification**
```bash
cd /Users/tanishkhot/Coding/Projects/Mayhouse/mayhouse-eth/contracts
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0x09aB660CEac220678b42E0e23DebCb1475e1eAD5
```

## 💡 **Understanding Your Contract:**

### **What You Can Do Now:**

1. ✅ **Create Events** (as host)
   - Stake 20% of total event value
   - Set price per seat
   - Set max seats
   - Set event date

2. ✅ **Book Events** (as user)
   - Pay ticket price + 20% stake
   - Seats reserved
   - Both payments locked in contract

3. ✅ **Complete Events** (as host)
   - Mark who attended
   - Attendees get stake back
   - No-shows forfeit stake
   - Host receives payments + stake back

4. ✅ **Cancel Events** (as host)
   - Full refund to all users
   - Host gets stake back

---

## 📊 **Example Transaction Flow:**

### **Host Creates Event:**
```
Price: 0.1 ETH/seat × 4 seats = 0.4 ETH total
Host stakes: 0.08 ETH (20%)
Status: Event Active ✅
```

### **User Books 2 Seats:**
```
Payment: 0.2 ETH
Stake: 0.04 ETH
Total: 0.24 ETH locked in contract
```

### **After Event:**
```
If attended:
  - User gets 0.04 ETH stake back ✅
  - Host gets 0.19 ETH (payment - 5% fee) ✅
  - Host gets 0.08 ETH stake back ✅

If no-show:
  - User forfeits 0.04 ETH ❌
  - Host still gets payment ✅
```

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **1. Test on Etherscan** ⭐
Try creating a test event directly on Etherscan to make sure everything works!

### **2. Create Frontend Integration**
I can help you build:
- Host dashboard to create events
- User booking flow
- Event completion interface
- Stake tracking display

### **3. Test Full Flow**
- Create event from frontend
- Book event from different wallet
- Complete event
- Verify stakes returned correctly

## 📝 **Important Notes:**

✅ This is **TESTNET** - no real money involved
✅ Contract is **immutable** - cannot be changed
✅ You are the **owner** - can update fees
✅ All transactions are **public** on blockchain
✅ Gas costs are **paid by transaction sender**

---

## 🆘 **Common Questions:**

**Q: Can I change the contract code?**
A: No, smart contracts are immutable. You'd need to deploy a new version.

**Q: Can I update the platform fee?**
A: Yes! As owner, you can call `updatePlatformFee(newFee)`

**Q: What if I lose my private key?**
A: You lose access to the owner functions. Keep it safe!

**Q: Can users on mainnet use this?**
A: No, this is only on Sepolia testnet. Deploy to mainnet separately.
