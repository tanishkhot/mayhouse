# Fixes Applied - Host Application & Navigation

## Issue
User was getting 422 error when submitting host application because the backend expected `user_id` as a body parameter, but the frontend wasn't sending it.

## Root Cause
The backend endpoints were designed for "temporary" testing with explicit `user_id` parameters, but we needed to extract the user ID from the JWT token instead (proper authentication).

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Authentication (`host_application.py`)

**Updated 3 endpoints to extract user_id from JWT token:**

#### A. POST `/users/host-application` (Submit Application)
- **Before:** Required `user_id` as a `Body` parameter
- **After:** Extracts `user_id` from JWT token in Authorization header
- **How:** Uses `verify_token()` to decode JWT and get `sub` claim

#### B. GET `/users/host-application` (Get My Application)
- **Before:** Required `user_id` as a `Query` parameter
- **After:** Extracts `user_id` from JWT token in Authorization header

#### C. GET `/users/host-application/eligibility` (Check Eligibility)
- **Before:** Required `user_id` as a `Query` parameter
- **After:** Extracts `user_id` from JWT token in Authorization header

**Code Pattern Used:**
```python
async def endpoint_function(
    authorization: str = Header(None),
) -> ResponseType:
    # Extract user_id from JWT token
    if not authorization or not authorization.startswith("Bearer "):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Missing or invalid authorization header"
        )
    
    token = authorization.replace("Bearer ", "")
    payload = verify_token(token)
    
    if not payload:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid or expired token"
        )
    
    user_id = payload.get("sub")
    if not user_id:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid token payload"
        )
    
    # Rest of function logic...
```

### 2. Frontend (No changes needed!)
The frontend API client (`api.ts`) already:
- Stores JWT token in localStorage
- Attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to all requests via interceptor
- Handles 401 errors by redirecting to login

So the frontend code continues to work without any modifications!

### 3. Auto-Host Upgrade (From Previous Changes)
- When a user creates their first experience, they're automatically upgraded to "host" role
- Host application submission also auto-approves and upgrades to host

## Testing
1. âœ… Backend running on port 8000
2. âœ… JWT authentication working
3. âœ… User ID extracted from token automatically
4. âœ… Frontend can now submit host applications without errors

## Benefits
- âœ… **Proper security:** User ID comes from verified JWT, not user input
- âœ… **No changes needed to frontend:** Authorization header already sent
- âœ… **Consistent with other endpoints:** Same auth pattern across API
- âœ… **Prevents spoofing:** Users can't pretend to be other users

## What This Means for You
Now when you click "Become a Host" (or just create an experience):
1. Your JWT token is sent with the request
2. Backend extracts your user ID from the token
3. Application is submitted and auto-approved
4. You're upgraded to host role
5. Success! ðŸŽ‰

**But Remember:** We've changed the UX to skip the host application entirely. Just click **"Create Experience"** in the navbar and you'll automatically become a host when you submit your first experience!
