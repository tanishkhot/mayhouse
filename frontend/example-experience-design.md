**Answer for Question 1:**

"I want to host an exclusive snooker experience at The Royal Snooker Club in Mayfair, London, where travelers will play actual frames with three world champions—Marcus 'The Maestro' Chen (3-time world champion), James 'The Thunder' O'Sullivan (2-time world champion), and Viktor 'The Iceman' Petrov (2-time world champion). This isn't a masterclass or a spectator event; it's a hands-on session where you play competitive frames against each champion, learn their techniques in real time, and get personalized coaching as you play.

What makes this special is the rare access to three different world-class playing styles in one session—Marcus's methodical precision, James's aggressive break-building, and Viktor's tactical safety play. You'll hear behind-the-scenes stories from championship matches, understand the mental game at the highest level, and see how these players interact with each other. The experience takes place in a private, championship-grade room at an exclusive members' club, creating an intimate setting where the champions are focused entirely on you.

Travelers will play multiple frames, receive real-time coaching tips, get commemorative photos and signed scorecards, and leave with techniques and insights they can't get anywhere else. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn from and play with the best players in the world, all in one unforgettable afternoon."

**Answer for Question 2:**

"We meet at the main entrance of The Royal Snooker Club, located at 47 St. James's Street, London SW1A 1NP. It's a private members' club in Mayfair, about a 5-minute walk from Green Park tube station (Jubilee, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines).

I'll be waiting outside the entrance at the scheduled time, wearing a navy blue blazer with a small Mayhouse logo pin on the lapel. I'll be holding a professional snooker cue case with my initials, so you'll easily spot me. Look for someone with a cue case—that's me.

The club has a red-brick Victorian facade with brass nameplates. There's a small courtyard with benches out front where I'll be standing. If you arrive early, you can wait in the courtyard, and I'll come out to greet you.

From Green Park station, exit towards Piccadilly, walk north on Piccadilly for about 200 meters, then turn right onto St. James's Street. The club will be on your left after about 100 meters—you can't miss the entrance with the brass plaque.

If you're coming by taxi or ride-share, tell the driver 'St. James's Street, near Green Park'—they'll know exactly where to go. The club is also just around the corner from The Ritz hotel, so that's another good landmark.

Once you see me, I'll greet you, check you in, and we'll head inside together. The club requires members to escort guests, so I'll be there to welcome you and take you through to the private snooker room where the champions will be waiting."

**Answer for Question 3:**

"What makes this experience unique is that you're not just watching world champions play—you're playing with them, learning from them, and getting personalized coaching in real time. This isn't a masterclass or a spectator event; it's an intimate, hands-on session where three of the world's best players are focused entirely on you.

The one thing travelers can't get anywhere else is the opportunity to play actual frames against three different world champions in one session, each with a distinct style. You'll experience Marcus Chen's methodical precision, James O'Sullivan's aggressive break-building, and Viktor Petrov's tactical safety play—all in the same afternoon, with each champion sharing their specific techniques and strategies as you play.

Most people can watch these players on TV or attend tournaments, but you can't get one-on-one time with three world champions simultaneously, playing actual competitive frames where they're genuinely engaged and teaching you their secrets. These players don't do group coaching sessions—this is a rare, curated experience that only happens through our exclusive access.

You'll also get to see how they interact with each other, hear their behind-the-scenes stories from championship matches, and understand the mental game at the highest level. It's like having a private session with three different coaches who are also the best players in the world, all in one unforgettable experience."

**Answer for Question 5:**

"Included in the experience: 3 hours of exclusive play with three world champions, access to a private championship-grade snooker table with proper lighting, professional snooker cues provided (or you can bring your own), personalized coaching tips from each champion during play, a private room with comfortable seating for breaks, refreshments (tea, coffee, soft drinks, and light snacks), a commemorative photo session with all three champions, signed scorecards from your matches, and a certificate of participation.

What to bring: Comfortable, smart-casual clothing (the club has a dress code—no jeans or trainers; collared shirts preferred), comfortable shoes suitable for standing for extended periods (no high heels or open-toed shoes), your own cue if you have one (optional—we provide professional cues), a camera or phone for photos (we'll also take professional photos), and a positive attitude ready to learn and have fun.

Requirements: Age 18+ (the club is a private members' establishment), basic understanding of snooker rules (you don't need to be expert, but familiarity with the game helps), moderate fitness level (you'll be standing and moving around the table for 3 hours), and respect for the club's etiquette (quiet during play, no mobile phones during frames, proper conduct expected).

Things to know: The experience is limited to one traveler at a time to ensure personalized attention, frames are played at a relaxed pace with coaching breaks between shots, the champions are friendly and encouraging—they're here to help you improve, not to intimidate, and you'll get to keep the scorecards and photos as mementos of this unique experience."
