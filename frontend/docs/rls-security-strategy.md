# Row Level Security (RLS) Strategy

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Basic RLS policies that don't enforce business logic or proper authorization

**Solution**: Comprehensive RLS policies that enforce business rules and data integrity at the database level

## 🎯 Key Security Improvements

### **1. Business Logic Enforcement** 🔥 **CRITICAL**

#### **Event Run Creation Control:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Hosts can create event runs for their approved experiences" ON event_runs FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (
        EXISTS(
            SELECT 1 FROM experiences e 
            WHERE e.id = experience_id 
            AND e.host_id = auth.uid() 
            AND e.status = 'approved'  -- ✅ ONLY APPROVED EXPERIENCES
        )
    );
```

**Business Impact:**
- ✅ **Prevents premature bookings** - No event runs for draft experiences
- ✅ **Quality control** - Only approved content can be booked  
- ✅ **Host ownership** - Can't create runs for other hosts' experiences

#### **Review Authenticity Control:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Travelers can create reviews for completed bookings" ON experience_reviews FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() = traveler_id 
        AND EXISTS(
            SELECT 1 FROM event_run_bookings erb 
            WHERE erb.id = event_run_booking_id 
            AND erb.traveler_id = auth.uid()
            AND erb.booking_status = 'experience_completed'  -- ✅ ONLY COMPLETED
        )
    );
```

**Business Impact:**
- ✅ **Prevents fake reviews** - Only actual attendees can review
- ✅ **Review authenticity** - Must have completed the experience
- ✅ **Platform credibility** - All reviews are from verified participants

### **2. Role-Based Access Control** 👥

#### **Admin Privileges:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all experiences" ON experiences FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can update host application status" ON host_applications FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
);
```

#### **Host Requirements:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Hosts can create experiences" ON experiences FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() = host_id 
        AND EXISTS(
            SELECT 1 FROM host_profiles hp 
            WHERE hp.user_id = auth.uid() AND hp.status = 'active'
        )
    );
```

**Security Benefits:**
- ✅ **Clear role separation** - Travelers, hosts, admins have distinct permissions
- ✅ **Graduated access** - More sensitive operations require higher privileges
- ✅ **Admin controls** - Platform management functions protected

### **3. Data Privacy Protection** 🔒

#### **Personal Data Access:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Travelers can view their own bookings" ON event_run_bookings FOR SELECT 
    USING (auth.uid() = traveler_id);

CREATE POLICY "Travelers can view their own payments" ON payments FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS(
        SELECT 1 FROM event_run_bookings erb 
        WHERE erb.id = event_run_booking_id AND erb.traveler_id = auth.uid()
    )
);
```

#### **Host Business Data Access:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Hosts can view bookings for their experiences" ON event_run_bookings FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS(
        SELECT 1 FROM event_runs er 
        JOIN experiences e ON er.experience_id = e.id 
        WHERE er.id = event_run_id AND e.host_id = auth.uid()
    )
);
```

**Privacy Benefits:**
- ✅ **Personal data isolation** - Users only see their own sensitive data
- ✅ **Financial privacy** - Payment info restricted to relevant parties
- ✅ **Business data protection** - Hosts only see their own business metrics

### **4. Public Content Control** 🌐

#### **Quality Gate Enforcement:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public can view approved experiences" ON experiences FOR SELECT 
    USING (status = 'approved');

CREATE POLICY "Public can view public reviews" ON experience_reviews FOR SELECT 
    USING (is_public = true);

CREATE POLICY "Public can view active host profiles" ON host_profiles FOR SELECT 
    USING (status = 'active');
```

**Quality Benefits:**
- ✅ **Content quality** - Only approved experiences visible publicly
- ✅ **Platform reputation** - Poor quality content filtered out
- ✅ **User experience** - Travelers only see ready-to-book experiences

## 🛡️ Security Enforcement Levels

### **Level 1: Basic Access Control**
- User can only access their own data
- Public users see only approved content
- Role-based function access

### **Level 2: Business Logic Enforcement**  
- Event runs require approved experiences
- Reviews require completed bookings
- Experience creation requires active host status

### **Level 3: Data Integrity Protection**

   - Can't review without completing experience
   - Can't review other users' bookings

2. **Unauthorized Content Creation** ❌ **BLOCKED**
   - Can't create experiences without host status  
   - Can't create event runs for unapproved experiences

3. **Data Privacy Breaches** ❌ **BLOCKED**

   - Can't view other users' payment information

4. **Business Logic Bypasses** ❌ **BLOCKED**
   - Can't bypass approval workflows
   - Can't circumvent role requirements

5. **Admin Function Abuse** ❌ **BLOCKED**
   - Admin functions require admin role
   - Regular users can't escalate privileges

## 💡 Development Benefits
